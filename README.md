=== CISC327 Group Project ===

This is the CISC327 group project @ Queen's University Computing 2016

The purpose of the project is to build a Simple Interactive Banking System (“SimBank”).
SimBank consists of two parts:
 - the Front End, a ATM banking transaction acceptor for simple ATM-style
banking transactions
 - the Back Office, an overnight batch processor to maintain and update a
master accounts file
Both parts will be run as console applications, that is, they are to be invoked from a
command line and use text and text file input/output only



== Instructions ==

To run the program, go to bin and run "./simbank arg1 arg2"
or add <path to repo>/bin to the $PATH and then run "simbank arg1 arg2"

A sample input file may be found at etc/testfile.txt
